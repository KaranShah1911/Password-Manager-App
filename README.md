This is a very cool application in today's world and for today's generation.

The inspiration of builiding this application came about because i was trying to register over a website, where it asked for a password which was <strong>insanely complicated</strong> üôçüôç.

- The major motive of this tool is to save your time for thinking such a brainstorming password and to remember it.
- You just need to input the name of the website to which you are logging in.
    Eg. Your google account, Amazon, LeetCode, etc.

- You need to mention the email - id with which you are accessing the website.
- Now, you can either create a password yourself or click the <strong>Generate Password</strong> button. This will generate a password which will be insanely complicated and will be accepted by every website and impossible to remember.
- So. I've embeded a functionality that will save your website name, email address and the passord when you hit the <strong>ADD Button</strong>, in a  <strong>data.json file</strong> which will automatically be created whenever you run the code for the first time on your system and will retain all the data forever, unless you manually delete it.
- After clicking Add the json file will be updated.
- If you leave any of the fields empty then a message will be popped up asking you to fill up all the fields.

- Now, if you come to the tool to find your website's password, then it is difficult to manually search through the json file. For that, there is a search button. After entering the websites name, click on search button. This will give you the email and password which was previously stored by you.

Start using this tool ASAP as it has proved to be a boon and i seriously had <strong>20</strong> entries on the day I made it üòäüòä.
