This is a very useful application in today's world and for today's generation.

The inspiration of builiding this application came about because i was trying to register over a website, where it asked for a password which was <strong>insanely complicated</strong> 🙍🙍.

- The major motive of this tool is to save your time for thinking such a brainstorming password and to remember it.
- You just need to input the name of the website to which you are logging in.
    Eg. Your google account, Amazon, LeetCode, etc.

- You need to mention the email - id with which you are accessing the website.
- Now, you can either create a password yourself or click the <strong>Generate Password</strong> button. This will generate a password which will be insanely complicated and will be accepted by every website and impossible to remember.
- So. I've embeded a functionality that will save your website name, email address and the passord when you hit the <strong>ADD Button</strong>, in a  <strong>data.txt file</strong> which will automatically be created whenever you run the code for the first time on your system and will retain all the data forever, unless you manually delete it.
- After clicking Add it will ask you for a confirmation, whether the entered detalis are correct. If you click "ok" then the txt file will be updated.
- If you leave any of the fields empty then a message will be popped up asking you to fill up all the fields.

Start using this tool ASAP as it has proved to be a boon for and i seriously had <strong>20</strong> entries on the day I made it 😊😊.
